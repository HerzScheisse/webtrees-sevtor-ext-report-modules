Released: February 2024

<a name="Description"></a>

## Description

Four new report definitions:
1. descendents-overview that can be used to generate a simple chart of the descendents to one person, with years of birth, marriage / partnership, divorce / separation, and death (if the years are known and the events have happened). 
2. family-tree that generates pedigree charts for a selected person. Up to eight generation including the start person can be shown depending on the paper size chosen. 8 generations can be viewed on A2 paper in landscape mode. 
3. family-history will generate a report in a narrative style for the selected person and either the closest family, the descendents or the ancestors. Notes and primary photos can optionally be included. 
4. family-individuals generates a report for the same selection of persons as family-history but all facts and events are presented in a table for each person. 

## Requirements

This module requires some changes of the app/Report part of **webtrees** that can be installed from here: 
1. <a href="https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/forum/attachment/9259?download=1">new-reports-2.1.x.zip</a> for webtrees versions 2.1.x,
2. <a href="https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/forum/attachment/9258?download=1">new-reports-2.2.x.zip</a> for webtrees versions 2.2.x 

Hopefully version 2.1.19(?) or later, with will have these changes included to support the new xml report features.
