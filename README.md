<a name="Description"></a>

## Description

Four new report definitions:
1. Descendents-overview that can be used to generate a simple chart of the descendents to one person, with years of birth, marriage / partnership, divorce / separation, and death (if the years are known and the events have happened). 
2. Family-tree that generates pedigree charts for a selected person. Up to eight generation including the start person can be shown depending on the paper size chosen. 8 generations can be viewed on A2 paper in landscape mode. 
3. Family-history will generate a report in a narrative style for the selected person and either the closest family, the descendents or the ancestors. Notes and primary photos can optionally be included. 
4. Family-individuals generates a report for the same selection of persons as family-history but all facts and events are presented in a table for each person.
